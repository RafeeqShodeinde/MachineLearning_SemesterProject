# MachineLearning_SemesterProject

The objective of this project was to predict the outcome(scores) of soccer matches using match statistics such as, home team shots, away team shots, home team fouls and many more features. To accomplish this task, this project was modelled as a supervised, batch, model-based learning system, implementing two different machine learning algorithms. The algorithms used were Random Forest Regression algorithm & SoftMax Regression
